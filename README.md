The Store API is an ecommerce platform of some sort that has two types of users, a customer and a store administrator. A customer mostly desires to browse and review products and where applicable buy them. An administrator on the other hand seeks to perform administrative tasks like creation of other administrators, system roles, manufacturers etc.
