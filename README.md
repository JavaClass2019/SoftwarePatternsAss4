This is an ecommerce Store API platform of some sort that has two types of users, a customer and a store administrator. A customer will be allowed to browse and review products and where applicable buy them. An administrator on the other will perform administrative tasks like creation of other administrators, system roles, manufacturers, other product CRUD functionalites, etc.
